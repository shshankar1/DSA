# Coding Round Checklist

This document outlines a structured approach for tackling coding interview problems, optimized for a **45‚Äì60 minute Google interview**.  
It ensures clarity of thought, strong communication, and correct implementation within the limited time.

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. Understand & Clarify Queries (‚è± ~5 min)
- Restate the problem in your own words.
- Ask clarifying questions about:
    - Input ranges, constraints, and data types.
    - Expected output format.
    - Edge conditions (e.g., empty arrays, negative numbers).
- Ensure alignment with the interviewer before moving ahead.

---

### 2. Discuss Algorithm + Complexity Upfront (‚è± ~10 min)
- Think **out loud** ‚Äî share your reasoning process.
- Propose **multiple approaches** if possible, with pros/cons.
- Mention **time and space complexities** early for each.
- Choose the most optimal solution based on constraints.

---

### 3. List Edge & Test Cases (‚è± ~5 min)
- Identify standard test cases:
    - Smallest inputs.
    - Large inputs near constraints.
    - Duplicate values.
    - Negative numbers or zeros (if applicable).
- Call out tricky cases upfront ‚Äî shows foresight.

---

### 4. Code Implementation (‚è± ~20‚Äì25 min)
- Write clean, modular, and readable code.
- Explain while coding:
    - Choice of data structures.
    - Looping/recursion decisions.
- Aim for a working version quickly; refine if time permits.

---

### 5. Dry Run with Tests (‚è± ~3‚Äì5 min)
- Walk through the code using earlier test cases.
- Verify correctness step-by-step.
- Catch off-by-one errors and edge conditions.

---

### 6. Re-State Time & Space Complexity (‚è± ~2‚Äì3 min)
- Summarize complexity of your final solution.
- If time allows, briefly mention possible optimizations or alternative approaches.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Principles
- **Communicate constantly**: silence makes interviewers nervous.
- **Be structured**: Clarify ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Optimize.
- **Handle edge cases**: Mention them before coding.
- **Demonstrate trade-offs**: Especially important at senior levels.
